A simple way to stay up to date with upcoming space launches, built with [React-Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), using the [Launch Library API](https://launchlibrary.net/).

## Installation

If you want to test the app on a simulator running locally, there's nothing more simple:

```bash
$ cd moonwalk

$ yarn

$ react-native run-ios
```

Although not deployed on the Google Play Store yet, the app is able to run on Android devices. To run the app, simply use the `react-native run-android` command. (This is an ongoing feature, expect some layout issues).
